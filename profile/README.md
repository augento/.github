We do DeepSeek R1 (like) fine tuning as a service. A user gives us an Agent and where it went wrong and we'll improve it.

We provide a turn key solution to customers to act on poorly performing agents, by providing feedback in our UI to the agent and we'll take care of improving the model with reinforcement learning.

Imagine a startup developing a tool for law firms, enhanced with an AI to assist lawyers in selecting clients. Currently, this startup would face significant challenges in building such a tool, as it’s crucial to provide accurate and consistent responses every time. With our technology, the startup can enhance the initial model by incorporating its own experience and feedback from beta users, eventually surpassing the initial model and delivering reliable results on every query.

Previously this team built: [hyveOS](https://docs.p2p.industries)

Building a swarm OS for robots seemed like a good idea and people liked it![^1]
For a lot of reasons this was not a sustaibale thing to do as a buisness and at its core this product doesn't have a paying market at the moment.
If you would like to use it, write to us, we might give it (and our thougts) to you! If you would like to talk to us about it, write to us!
It's possible that the time for this product just hasn't come (yet).
